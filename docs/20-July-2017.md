# RPID Meeting Minutes

## Puppetizing
  *Bridget thinks that the puppet scripts that she has available now might be usable for installation of IU machine if in August

### PID API
   * Gabriel is most familiar with this already
   * What is needed to PID API to make it compatible with the kernel information?
   * PID API is kernel information aware - used extensions to retrieve profile definition
   * Beth thinks we need to review that extension
   * Yu - there is functionality to assign PID
   * Bridget we need code available for puppet setup and for those code extensions to be reviewed - these are in D2I Github now (https://github.com/Data-to-Insight-Center/RDA-PRAGMA-Data-Service/tree/master/pragmapit-ext/src/main/javadoc)
   * Isuru says we can fork the extension code into the RPID Github so Bridget can get to it
   * Bridget  - Can we tag original code and tag changes and submit back to RDA as proposed revision?
   * Beth - write small client to try out the API - look at what is research data and what is not? Need requirements for this before we move on it.
   * Isuru - PID enabled layer on top of handle system APIs and client - we need a PID aware strawman layer - 
   
### Handle Server
  * This is crashing on us and we don't know why
  * Has been down for 3 days now
  * Bridget - could run this on Amazon - would need all of the other parts for replication - federation of local handle servers
  * Isuru - will work with Bridget's amazon instance for demo purposes - need to contact RT to see if this can be done for demo tomorrow at 1

### 


### Jetstream VMs
   * Richard Higgins and Robert are working on this - Richard came to meeting today will join us to look at Jetstream PID mapping.
   * Robert will talk to Rob Quick when returns about getting Richard onto Slack and other channels for comm etc.
   
### PRAGMA/Rice Genomics
   * No Updates
   
## Karst Node
   * Expecting August 1 implementation - see Bridget's comments about use of puppet scripts for installation

## UAG
   * At https://rpidproject.github.io/rpid/UAG-Expectations/

## Action Items
   * Rob should check on whether puppet scripts will help with server installation in August
   * Isuru should fork code repo so that it is available from D2I git to RPID git
   * Yu will take two use cases - provenance and trust - seadtrain use-case - from that he will extract requirements for extensions to PID API - post to slack and get feedback
   *
