Bridget Questions: 
   * "I have some questions for the CNRI team on the x509 certificates in both the Handle Server and Cordra: will we be using only self-signed certificates in the test bed? Are we supporting HTTPS entry points on these? If so, the self-signed certs are likely to be problematic.  I was thinking we would do the initial setup with the self-signed certs generated by the services and allow for users of the puppet manifests to specify their own CA signed certs if they had them. Is this approach reasonable?"
   * "A second question, specifically on Cordra - have we decided on a handle component for DTR records? I note that Cordra defaults to adding a .1- to the handle prefix for DTR records (at least I think that's what it's doing). I know we had a discussion about prefix components and that handles given to users of the test bed will  be 11723.9.test.* . Where do the DTR records fit in this?"
